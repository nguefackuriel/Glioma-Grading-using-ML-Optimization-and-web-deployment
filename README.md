# Glioma-Grading-using-Machine-Learning-techniques-Model-optimization-and-web-deployment

This project aims to Optimize ML models and deploy the best ML algorithm using Streamlit for Glioma grading tumors.


The app can be tested using this [link](https://glioma-grading-using-ml-optimization.streamlit.app/)

The project has been done in collaboration with [Solafa Fadlallah](https://github.com/Solafa11), [Kobby Panford-Quainoo](https://github.com/panford), [Phanie Dianelle Negho](https://github.com/PhanieDianelle) and [Dieu-Donn√© Fangnon](https://github.com/dfangnon).


The paper related to this work was presented at the [IEEE 25th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science](https://homepages.uc.edu/~niunn/IRI24/) from August 7 - August 9, 2024 in San Jose, CA, USA.
